OpenViva is the open-source continuation of Project Viva, originally made by [Sir Hal](https://www.patreon.com/sgthale) (Go donate to his amazing work!). OpenViva is a VR and non-VR compatible game where you can interact with your very own stylized AI character! It features advanced AI simulation which can interact and respond to many of your actions in-game dynamically through inverse kinematics, complex behavior trees, and over hundreds of different, unique animations! Your character's mood is dynamic and responds to how you treat it, allowing you to play with it, feed it, or just be friends with it. Just like a Tamagotchi!

# Community
The OpenViva team is a group of techies dedicated to continuing Viva Project as a free and open-source game under the name "OpenViva", ultimately with the goal of rebuilding it in Unreal Engine 5. All assets and scripts are available to anyone who wants to download, modify, and tinker around with them. If you have any questions or want to help us, feel free to initiate the following 6 step plan!

1. [Join our community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/w7rFnssghW) (we'd love to have you around) and ask for help!
2. Head on over to the [#help](https://discord.com/channels/730428444256632943/1069409562999914649) channel.
3. Browse around, maybe someone's had the same question as you!
4. If you can't find the answer you're looking for, go ahead and click that shiny "New Post" button.
5. Type in your question, provide some details, click "Post".
6. Profit! Congratulations, a server member will now stop by and help you out with whatever you need!

# Developers Wanted, Dead or Alive
Unfortunately, we're a small team and are always looking for more developers to join in and help us improve the game. If that piques your interest, or if you're interested in contributing, please, **please**, [contact us on our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/w7rFnssghW).

But hey, for those one-off additions to the game, feel free to create a PR! We don't bite, we promise...

## Setup
If you're feeling spicy and want to try your hand in creativity, or just dabble around, here's our trademark *EasyGuide™*!

*The EasyGuide™ (patent pending) assumes you have rudimentary knowledge of Google, Unreal Engine, and Windows.*

### Prerequisites
To get your new idea off the ground, you're going to need a couple of things first:
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Unreal Engine 5.1.1](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

### Downloading
Now, most people would be tempted to click the bright green code button, and you're right!
1. Click on the bright green "Code" button.
2. Click "[Open with GitHub Desktop](x-github-client://openRepo/https://github.com/OpenViva/OpenViva-UE5)"
3. Click "Clone"
4. Have a nice coffee break while you wait for the OpenViva project to beam itself onto your computer!
5. When the download finishes, open up the "VivaUnreal.uproject" file.
6. Slowly decay into ash as your flesh melts away, all while you wait for Unreal Engine to compile shaders.
7. Unleash your creativity and let your ideas run wild!
8. When you've had your fun, commit and push your changes with a nice little message in the Github Desktop app.
9. Create a pull request, name it something cool like "Improve Performance", or "Make AI Smarter". Any improvements are welcome!
10. Feel that dopamine rush flow directly into your brain, you've earned it!

## Copyrights

In all seriousness, this repository is our own reimagining of Viva Project, done in Unreal Engine 5. We believe this is a game that should be made and run by the community, for the community. This is why OpenViva is released under the AGPLv3 license, as to ensure everyone gives back to the community.
